# About

The inagural Research Bazaar (ResBaz) took place in Melbourne in January of 2015. Now in our fourth year, ResBaz continues to showcase the latest digital tools available, most of which are open source.

Research Platform Services, The University of Melbourne, is proud to present Melbourne's 2018 ResBaz. The aim of the event is to bring together researchers from all career stages. The theme of this year's conference is: **work smarter not harder!**

Participants will be introduced to tools with 30 minute interactive pitches, allowing each person to sample a variety of tools. Most tools have an optional follow-on training. Under the big tent, the bazaar will feature keynote speakers, activities and a chance to interact and share stories and experiences of your research journey. Catering is key to a sucessful conference . We are famous for the food & beverage service we provide at ResBaz and assure you that you wont be dissapointed.
