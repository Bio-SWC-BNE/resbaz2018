| **Software Carpentry in Python**<br>An introduction to Python, automation and version control for researchers. Python is used in engineering, science, and the humanities to wrangle and analyze data, including textual data.<br><br> | **Software Carpentry in R**<br>An introduction to R, automation and version control for researchers. R is used by researchers in all disciplines to perform a wide range of statistical analyses and data visualisations, including text and data mining.<br><br> |
| **Open Refine**<br>An introduction to Open Refine, a powerful tool for working with messy data. Open Refine is the perfect partner to Excel. It is used for exploring, normalising and cleaning datasets, and extending data through web Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).<br><br> | **Excel Fu**<br>Data is often messy, incomplete, and error-ridden. This workshop uses one of the most widespread tools, Microsoft Excel, to import, sort, filter, copy, protect, transform, summarise, merge, and visualise research data.<br><br> |
| **Using Databases & SQL**<br>An introduction to relational databases and Structured Query Language (SQL). Relational databases are an extremely efficient, fast and widespread means of storing large amounts of structured data, and SQL is the standard means for reading from and writing to databases.<br><br> | **Web Scraping**<br>Web Scraping involves converting non-tabular or poorly structured data into a usable, structured format, usually a spreadsheet. Scraping is incredibly useful for acquiring data where it has been made inaccessible by the way it is presented online. Scraping can also be useful for tracking changes and archiving.<br><br> |
