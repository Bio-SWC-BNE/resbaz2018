# About

The Research Bazaar is a worldwide festival promoting the digital literacy emerging at the centre of modern research. Throughout 2018 (but with a focus on late January / early February), events will be held at a number of university campuses around the globe.

The University of Otago hosted a Research Bazaar event in February 2018. It was so much fun, that we're doing it again in July!  This time the format and content will be a little bit different...

Hosted by the University of Otago, the SECOND 2018 Dunedin Research Bazaar is a free-of-charge event comprising two days of workshops (July 4 and 5), and one day of high impact talks and demonstrations (July 6), where researchers come together to up-skill in ‘next generation digital research tools and skills’.  

In the spirit of a marketplace or bazaar, ResBaz is a highly participatory event where researchers from many different disciplines can learn, share knowledge and skills, and have fun!<br><br> Who should attend? Researchers at ALL levels from ALL disciplines.

We are still working on the programme to bring you a broad range of digital research skills topics - below are some of the sessions that will be on offer.
