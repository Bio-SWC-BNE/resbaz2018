## Day 1 & 2: Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, and the advanced stream

Over the three days of the event, two Software Carpentry and other upskilling workshops will run simultaneously. These hands-on workshops will cover basic computer programming concepts and tools for researchers, including program design, version control, data management, and task automation. Participants can elect to participate in either the Python stream or R stream.
