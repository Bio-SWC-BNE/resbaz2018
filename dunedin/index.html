        <div>
          <expandable-heading title="The Unix shell">
	    Use of the shell is fundamental to using a wide range of other powerful tools and computing resources (including “high-performance computing” supercomputers). These lessons will start you on a path towards using these resources effectively.

	  <expandable-heading title="Version control with Git">
	    Version control is the lab notebook of the digital world - it’s what professionals use to keep track of what they’ve done and to collaborate with other people. Keeping a record of what was changed, when, and why is extremely useful for all researchers if they ever need to come back to the project later on.
