# About

The Research Bazaar is a worldwide festival promoting the digital literacy emerging at the center of modern research. Throughout 2018, events will be held at a number of university campuses around the globe.

<b>ResBaz Tucson will be hosted by the University of Arizona on March 29th and 30th, 2018.</b> It is organized and sponsored by collaborators at the University of Arizona.

The Tucson Research Bazaar is a (free-of-charge) 2-day intensive conference where researchers come together to up-skill in ‘next generation digital research tools and skills’.  In the spirit of a marketplace or bazaar, ResBaz is a highly participatory event where researchers from many different disciplines can learn, share knowledge and skills, and have fun!

Who should attend? Researchers at ALL levels from ALL disciplines. PhD and research Masters students are especially encouraged to apply. Research technologists who support researchers to do their job should also come along!
