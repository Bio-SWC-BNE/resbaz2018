## Day 1 & 2: Software Carpentry

Over the first two days of the event, two Software Carpentry workshops will run simultaneously. These hands-on workshops will cover basic computer programming concepts and tools for researchers, including program design, version control, data management, and task automation.

Participants can elect to participate in either the Python stream or R stream.
