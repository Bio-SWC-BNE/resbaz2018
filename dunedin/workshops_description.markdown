# ResBaz 2018 workshop information

The section below provide details of the workshop sessions that will be run during ResBaz 2018.

Note that:
- A "\*" denotes the recommended introductory data analysis stream: this series of workshops will provide beginners with a solid introduction to key programming and reproducible research skills.
