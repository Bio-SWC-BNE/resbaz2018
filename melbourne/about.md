# About

The Research Bazaar is a worldwide festival promoting the digital literacy emerging at the center of modern research. Throughout 2018 (but with a focus on January / February), events will be held at a number of university campuses around the globe.

Research Platform Services, The University of Melbourne, is proud to present Melbourne's 2018 Research Bazaar. The aim of the event is to introduce researchers from all career stages and disciplines to the digital skills and tools required to do their research better, faster and smarter. The theme of this year's conference is: **work smarter not harder!**

Participants will be introduced to tools with 30 minute interactive pitches, allowing each person to sample a variety of tools. Each tool has an optional follow-on training.
