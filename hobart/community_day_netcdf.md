This session will give an overview of the basic concepts you need to understand when dealing with data stored in [netCDF][netCDF] format (e.g. common metadata conventions). A demonstration of how to interact with netCDF files using Python and R will be given, followed by a discussion of tools that can be used when netCDF files get really large.
