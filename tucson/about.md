# About

The Research Bazaar is a worldwide festival promoting the digital literacy emerging at the center of modern research. Throughout 2018 (but with a focus on late January / early February), events will be held at a number of university campuses around the globe.

Hosted by the University of Otago, the 2018 Dunedin Research Bazaar is a (free-of-charge) 3-day intensive conference where researchers come together to up-skill in ‘next generation digital research tools and skills’.  In the spirit of a marketplace or bazaar, ResBaz is a highly participatory event where researchers from many different disciplines can learn, share knowledge and skills, and have fun!<br><br> Who should attend? Researchers at ALL levels from ALL disciplines. PhD and research Masters students are especially encouraged to apply. Research technologists who support researchers to do their job should also come along!<br><br>We are still working on the programme to bring you a broad range of digital research skills topics - below are some of the sessions that will be on offer.
