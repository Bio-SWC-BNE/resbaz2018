# About

The Research Bazaar is a worldwide festival promoting the digital literacy emerging at the center of modern research. Throughout 2018 (but with a focus on late January / early February), events will be held at a number of university campuses around the globe.

Research Platforms. The University of Melbourne, is proud to present 2018's Research Bazaar. The aim of the event is to introduce researchers from all career stages and disciplines with the digital skills and tools required to do their research better, faster and smarter. The theme of this year's conference is: *work smarter not harder!*
